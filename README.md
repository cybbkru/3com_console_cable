# Console cable for 3Com switch
 
To solder it I referenced to [switch manual](HPE_c02586145_Baseline_Switch_2226-SFP_Plus_2426-PWR_Plus_2250-SFP_Plus_Installation_and_User_Guide.pdf) page 77 figure "Console cable".  
But there is error - they connect CD signal to the ground.

This work well for me with Baseline Switch 2226-SFP Plus:
